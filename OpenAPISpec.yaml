  description: "# Introduction\no9 Market Intelligence is the digital situational awareness needed by digitally enabled businesses. It comprises the information about the consumer behaviour, market structure, cultural events as well as broad economic indicators. This intelligence supplements the internal data generated by operations. Using a 360 degree view of the business results in better decisions.\n\nYou can find out more at [o9 Solutions' Website](https://o9solutions.com/solutions/revenue/market-intelligence/)\n\n## Knowledge Hub\nThe Knowledge Hub is the web service that serves the data and knowledge models for o9 Market Intelligence. This document lists all the APIs of this web service. These APIs require an token that you should request from o9.\n\n## Authentication\nWe use Bearer authentication with the token signifier being 'ApiKey'. Contact your o9 partner to get your authentication token. The token should be sent in the 'Authorization' key of the HTTP header, formatted as under\n\n***Authorization :*** `ApiKey apikey.fromO9solutions`\n   \n## Filtering Results\nFilter conditions are specified in the form of a JSON object as a query parameter called 'filters'. Some example filters are listed below\n\n***Filter using dimension fields returned in the API***\n\n`[{ \"AttributeName\" : \"City\", \"Values\" : [\" Dallas : TX Dallas County\", \"Boston : MA Suffolk County\"] }]`\n\n***Filter using higher level grouping of the dimension fields [Refer to the respective dimension API]***\n\n`[{ \"AttributeName\" : \"Country\", \"Values\" : [\"USA\", \"NLD\"], \"DimensionName\" : \"Geo\" }]`\n\n***Filter using Named Sets [See list of valid values in the next section]***\n\n`[{ \"AttributeName\" : \"Day\", \"NamedSet\" : \"CurrentDay\" }]`\n\n***Filter using date ranges***\n\n`[{ \"AttributeName\":\"Day\", \"DateRanges\" : [{\"op\" : \">=\", \"value\" : \"2021-06-01\"},{\"op\" : \"<\", \"value\" : \"2021-06-03\"}], \"DimensionName\" : \"Time\" }]`\n\n***Multiple filter conditions***  \nThe filters object is an array of filter conditions. Multiple filters can be combined together for a more refined search. Some examples:\n\n- Specific values\n\n`[{ \"AttributeName\" : \"City\", \"Values\" : [\" Dallas : TX Dallas County\"] }, {\"AttributeName\" : \"Day\", \"NamedSet\" : \"CurrentDay\" }]`\n\n- Ranges\n\n`[{ \"AttributeName\" : \"Country\", \"Values\" : [\"USA\", \"NLD\"], \"DimensionName\" : \"Geo\" }, { \"AttributeName\":\"Day\", \"DateRanges\" : [{\"op\" : \">=\", \"value\" : \"2020-07-01\"}], \"DimensionName\" : \"Time\" }]`\n   \n## Named Sets\n\nThese are short-hand notations for some commonly used filters for the time dimension\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Named Set</strong></td>\n<td ><strong>Filter condition</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Last3yrs</td>\n<td>The last 1096 days including today</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Last3yrs+Next1mth</td>\n<td>The last 1096 days plus the next 30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n"

It represents the common component of ten different daily and weekly series covering consumer behavior, the labor market, and production. The WEI is scaled to the four-quarter GDP growth rate; for example, if the WEI reads -2 percent and the current level of the WEI persists for an entire quarter, one would expect, on average, GDP that quarter to be 2 percent lower than a year previously. \nThe WEI is a composite of 10 weekly economic indicators: Redbook same-store sales, Rasmussen Consumer Index, new claims for unemployment insurance, continued claims for unemployment insurance, adjusted income/employment tax withholdings (from Booth Financial Consulting), railroad traffic originated (from the Association of American Railroads), the American Staffing Association Staffing Index, steel production, wholesale sales of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, and weekly average US electricity load (with remaining data supplied by Haver Analytics). All series are represented as year-over-year percentage changes. These series are combined into a single index of weekly economic activity.\nFor additional details, including an analysis of the performance of the model, see Lewis, Mertens, and Stock (2020), �U.S. Economic Activity during the Early Weeks of the SARS-Cov-2 Outbreak.� (https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr920)\nThis index has been developed by Daniel Lewis, an economist in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Karel Mertens, a senior economic policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and James Stock, the Harold Hitchings Burbank Professor of Political Economy, Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University.\nThe index is not an official forecast of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, its president, the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Open Market Committee."
